Ok, let me start by saying: I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing 

I have never, in the entirety of my life, created a GitHub Repository. I have coded, sure, but never like this. This is on a whole other level 
I'm making an exception though, to whoever shall see this and you're fan of the hit rhythmn game Friday Night Funkin', welcome! 
For those of you out of the loop, Friday Night Funkin' was created by NinjaMuffin095, KawaiSprite, evilsk8r, and PhantomArcade, alongside a miriad of other creators/contributors (Hundred, I'm looking at you, dude) 
It was made for the Ludum Dare competition prompt "Stuck in a Loop" and it has become, even 5 years later, one of the most iconic rhythmn games of our time, right alongside Osu! and DDR
This game has inspired so many mods and so many fan-creators who have even gone on to work with the Funkin' crew itself (Saruky is one example)

But anyways, I'm getting off-topic. I created this repository as a way of curbing my impatience. Because, frankly, I want Week 8 so badly and also the full game
Yes, I understand a game like this will take quite a while to make, especially consider all the goals achieved by the Kickstarter (which, by the way, managed to get over 2M dollars of support, actually insane)

Don't expect posts daily, only when I feel like it (I don't wanna feel pressured to do this, 'kay)
I'm gonna post about anything related to the game, maybe even fan-related stuff too, in whatever order I please, no complaining

To the few people reading this, thanks for sticking around and I hope you consider starring this repository. I know it's not technically the correct way to use one of these, but whatever, first amendment rights...

Oh, yeah, and I'm not gonna use AI to write the posts, they're gonna be hand-written by me because I'm awesome (My mom thinks so, anyways ;) )
