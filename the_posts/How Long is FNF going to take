Hello everyone, I’m feeling much better now.
Today’s topic is very much related to FNF, thankfully, sorry for the boast last post, I have no idea what came over me
We’re finally discussing the elephant in the room, the full release of Friday Night Funkin, so let’s get into it

Let’s start with some statistics real quick
The full game will have 60+ weeks, as confirmed by ninjamuffin himself
This means that there is likely going to be hundreds of thousands of assets being involved to make each week set, especially if there are set-changes between songs
The game will also have 2000+ songs, if we’re considering the original songs and their remixes for the 8 other playable characters, and also including the ERECT remixes too

On the programming side of things, there’s also quite a lot to accomplish
They have to program a way to see the leaderboards for each song, animations before each week (at the minimum), a way to play 2 player locally, and more
Let’s also not forget all those goals that were reached, like, for example, the mobile build of the game and the custom character creator, to name a few

Now, PhantomArcade has gone on record, back in May 4th of last year in a Twitch stream, to say that the base game is “a little more than 60% done”
Now, I can only assume he’s referring to the actual game and not the demo that we currently have
If he’s referring to the demo, however, then that means there’s not gonna be all too many free weeks left before we have to wait for the full game to release
We could be talking a few months to a couple of years for the game to be published on Steam

So why did I make this post about the full game
Well, I just wanted to get that off my chest because the whole reason I’m making these posts is to curb my impatience for the full release (or, at least, the next update)
Also, yes, I realize I can curb my frustration by looking at old FNF media and playing FNF mods, but I prefer writing, really lends a look into your soul, y’know

Anyways, thanks for stopping by and reading today’s post! 
Make sure to star this repo and follow me for more FNF posts (on the off-chance that I’ve run out of ideas, read the other posts, kay)
Stay knightly, my friends, goooodbyeee
