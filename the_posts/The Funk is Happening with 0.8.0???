Hellooo, is this on? The mic is turned up to eleven, I think…

Nah, just kidding, I’m not gonna paint the medium with this one. Welcome back to another FNF blog post.
I’ve decided to return because I miss posting and I want to get back on it.
Today’s blog post is about the 0.8.0 update (of which I misunderstood as shown by my previous post)

The milestone names have been changing, to put it simply.
I dunno if this type of thing happens often, but it surely is weird.
I guess it’s to generate hype, or more likely it’s to keep people interesting.
They sure have me hooked, that’s for sure, like they’re playing with my dang soul.

Oh, wait, I didn’t give the context, my baddd, didn’t mean to ramble on without the most crucial of informations
If you don’t already know, Funkin has a GitHub repository (Why did you think I created this account in the first place) and the goal is 
to share which features are coming in the next update
I could go into detail on how it works, yapping about commits and pull requests, but I’ll save that for another time, if y’all wanna actually hear it
There’s this feature called “Milestones” which allows them (the coding team for FNF) to store which bug fixes/hotfixes will be resolved in the next update
Currently they have open 0.7.0 (which is just to fix charting issues and bugs and also the Mobile port) and 0.8.0
0.7.0 was published for more than a month now, I think, and I think all the issues to be resolved have been added (but who knows)
0.8.0 just recently came around, with an ever-changing name

Now that I’ve given y’all context, let us continueee
Already I’ve seen the milestone being changed first to "Skibidi Toilet crossover" (ew, I fell for that genuinely) and now it’s called “Playable Boyfriend”
Again, it’s a weird decision on the coding team’s part, but whatever, you got accounts like Funkin Remnants talking about it, so congrats!

Anyways, the OTHER major news that came for FNF today was the announcement of the Mobile port
Mobile ports/ APKs have been available for Friday Night Funkin since the dawn of its creation
However, those were fan-made ports and now we’re getting the actual thing, as promised from the Kickstarter.
I don’t currently use any unofficial mobile port of the game because I was waiting eagerly for the team to drop this
Also how the funk are you supposed to play using a mobile screen, you tap the notes as they appear, similar to Magic Tiles???

Anyways, that is it for today’s post, just a few quick reminders 
I won’t be posting daily, as I feel that’s way too much pressure for one guy to handle
Also I’m removing the post where I have my sulking moment, I think I wounded QUITE a few peoples’ heartstrings there, in a few days
Finally, I will continue to keep track of the 0.8.0 milestone name and update y’all on this post

Alright, thanks for stopping by and reading
Make sure to watch this repository for the latest changes and follow me if you wanna, no pressure though
Stay Knightly, my friends, and byeeee

WE ARE SO BACK, LESSS GOOOOOOOOO
