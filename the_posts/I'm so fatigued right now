Hey everyone, sorry, but no detailed post today
I decided to get my workout on (I've been doing this for the past 2 days, as a basis) and overdid it just a little*
Don’t worry, tomorrow’s post is gonna be great and well-anticipated, I can promise you that much

Stay Knightly and Have a Wonderful Rest of the Day, goodbyeeee


*and by a little, Mester means doing 1011 calories in only 105 minutes, basically the equivalent of one and a 1/20th workout cycle
He’s been wanting to do this forever and has finally achieved more than 1000 calories in one session
No need to worry for him, he is well-aware of the repercussions and will take in stride to ensure, at the worst, that he doesn’t die*
