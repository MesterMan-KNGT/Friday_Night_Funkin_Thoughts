Hello hello, everyone, and welcome back to another enticing post about the hit rhythm game Friday Night Funkin, authored by me and edited by me
Today’s topic is more so on the gameplay itself rather than the actual lore
I realize the last two posts were definitely lore-heavy and I want to represent all aspects of the community
(By the way, fans of the mods, I’m gonna make a post specifically for y’all, just be patient)
So, without further ado, these are the most difficult levels in terms of charting

Cocoa on Hard Mode, BF 
Ok, so usually Cocoa is regarded as a pretty easy level, especially considering it’s in the first 5 weeks of the game
Cocoa’s Hard difficulty, however, takes the usual pattern and cranks it up a notch
Not only do you have to start memorizing a pattern if you want to hit all the notes, but you have to do so in perfect time.
Now, thankfully, this level has some hold notes in it, which makes it pretty easy to regain health and not get blue-balled
It’s not a hard level if you can keep and press notes at a quick pace, but for me, it definitely is

Roses on Medium and Hard Mode, BF
This one is self-explanatory, lots of notes and pressing note patterns quickly
I don’t think I need to go into much detail for this one…
Just know this, when Senpai is angry, you better watch out!

Guns on Medium and Hard Mode, BF
This one I was bound to complain about, let’s just say that
I don’t even know why the Funkin’ team hasn’t nerfed this level yet, cause it’s so tricky 
This one requires you to not only press notes in fast succession, like the last level, but also press all four notes IN ORDER
This level presents the “four-way” pattern about nine to ten times near the ascended part
It’s an overall very tricky level and requires a lot of skill to beat, and a lot of patience too
I’ve restarted the level no more than 20 times, but I think I’m getting better at it
It should be noted that this level has the second-highest BPM of the entire game (185), only bested by Thorns (190)


Lit Up on Hard Mode, BF
Now we’re going into levels that are a bit more recent (think from the Weekend Update to the Pitstop 2 Update)
Lit Up, for both characters, is a very difficult sequence of events and requires your full attention
As of writing of this, only a few hours prior, I have beaten all the difficulties for the Lit Up level for Pico
But, unfortunately, I can’t seem to keep up with the immensely fast pace that the Boyfriend vs. Darnell has to offer
As you get more and more up the difficulty chain, the charting speed at which the level operates increases
This is comparable to the “double-note dilemma” that the Pico levels have to offer 
But anyways, this level is extremely difficult on all modes, but especially on Hard Mode

Stress on Hard Mode, Pico
When it comes to Stress, I would say I’m an aficionado of the level
That being said, the Pico remix of Stress has an insanely difficult level on all modes
I’m mentioned Hard Mode, specifically, because not only do you have to keep pressing notes in quick succession (a staple of this level), but you also have the double notes
I get there’s only so many ways you can make a level difficult before it becomes almost unplayable, 
but still, the amount of those combos in this specific level is insane

So, yeah, those are the hardest levels of Friday Night Funkin for me
Let me know in the comments which are the hardest for you
As always, have a wonderful rest of the day, and stay knightly, my friends, byeee


P.S. I’ve not mentioned the ERECT and NIGHTMARE difficulties solely because those are inherently difficult, but I have completed some of those modes for some songs, not to brag
