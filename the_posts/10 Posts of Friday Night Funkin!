…You know what, this is my series, I can do whatever I want (within reason), and that includes being egoistic 
Today’s post, therefore, is going to be about how I have created 10 official posts regarding Friday Night Funkin
To be more precise, I have created 7 content posts and 2 update posts (not including this one)

But anyways, where are my manners, hello everyone, and welcome back to the Friday Night Funkin Thoughts repo
The place where you can find almost-perfect quality content about FNF and its many different sub-mods
I am proud to have kept this going for 10 days and I can’t wait for the next 90 (as the next milestone post will be at 100)

Here are some announcements for the future:
I have plans to make posts regarding the easiest and favorite levels of FNF, as proposed by me earlier
I also have plans to create “mod week” posts (more on that when I decide to do it, a week before I’ll tell all)
Finally, next month, also proposed by moi, I’ll reveal the secrets about how these are made (and no, I’m not using AI, AI can’t make the cheap kind of jokes that I can, haha)

Thank you all so much for sticking with me these 10 days and let’s keep this hype-train going or should I say, this hype-beats
(Yeah, I know, I can do way better, I’m just proving a point :) )
Stay Knightly, my friends, and goodbyeee
