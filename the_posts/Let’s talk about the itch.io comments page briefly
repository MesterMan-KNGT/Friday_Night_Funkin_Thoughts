Hello there citizens of the interbuzz, this is Mester coming at ya with another post fer-om the thoughts repository
(Shoutout to those who got the reference, it’s a Renthedog one)
Today’s post will briefly mention about the itch.io page, specifically about the comments

Before I begin, I would like to address something
Toxicity is a MAJOR problem on the Internet
Every day, acts of cruelty and degradation are done, sometimes almost intentionally and others without meaning to
I experienced one of these types while on the comments page for FNF on itch and lemme tell ya, it’s not pleasant
I’m used to the hate, I’ve been on the Internet long enough that I’ve grown a hard shell, but it didn’t make me any less worried

We’re living in a time where people can comment whatever they want under the first amendment, and while this is great and all, some people choose to abuse their powers
I guess I’m not making much sense since I’m hurrying to finish this, but the main takeaway is that: choose kindness over your destructive feelings

Anyways, see y’all tomorrow, probably another short post or maybe a more detailed one, we shall see
Thanks for reading the posts and make sure to star this repo so you don’t miss out!
Stay knightly, my friends, goooodbyeee
