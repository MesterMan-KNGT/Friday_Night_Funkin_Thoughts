Hello, everyone, welcome back to another post, Post #6 to be precise (if we’re not counting the first post that was the introduction)
Today’s topic is regarding Week 8 and 9 predictions
Not gonna lie, this is gonna be a pretty short one, as there is practically zero information on these weeks

So let’s get right into it, starting with Week 8
Now, two characters come to mind when I think Week 8: Nene and Cassandra
Nene, as you all probably by now but here’s a refresher anyways, is a knife-happy girl who finds herself to be Pico’s “girlfriend”
The evidence that Nene is gonna be Week 8’s opponent comes from the final cutscene from Weekend 1, where she is furiously ripping up a picture of BF and GF
I could be incorrectly hypothesizing here, I mean, she was and probably still is mad at them for causing Pico’s betrayal
But honestly, if there ever any opponent for Boyfriend to verse against, it’s Nene

Now, what about Week 9, why am I predicting so far ahead?
Well, thanks to my super-sleuth skills (mostly researching using Friday Night Funkin’s official wiki, not the fandom mod one), I’ve found evidence of what Week 9 is gonna be about
The character in question is Hank J. Wimbleton, the main character of Madness Combat
This is speculated because of a song title that KawaiSprite “leaked” called Homic*de 
Now, not being a Madness Combat fan, I have no idea what connection there could be between that song title and Hank, but I do know there’s a lot of violence
(Honestly, I think I found my next Newgrounds watch, to be honest)

So those are my predictions for Week 8 and 9, hopefully we get them pretty soon
Obviously, I acknowledge how long it takes to program in weeks, but I do think they might release it at least this year, considering they had a few years 
Honestly, I don’t know for sure, but till that point, I’m gonna keep posting to quench my FNF thirst

Thanks for stopping by, and have a wonderful day!
Stay knightly, my friends, goodbyeeeee
