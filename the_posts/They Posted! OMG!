Hello guys and gals and welcome back to the FNF_Thoughts storage space that is used to store code but is instead being used to store posts
If you didn’t see yesterday, or you’re chronically online like I am (I know, it’s pathetic, but whatever), the twitter account FNF_Developers posted something
For those of you rolling your eyes, I know, Twitter/X is a cesspool of absolute nonsense and toxicity, has been since the Big EM took over
But listen, there is information that gave out, stuff I’ve been holding back on saying, so let me “cook”, aight

The FNF Developers is the primary account of communication for anything officially related to the Funkin’ Crew, created back in 2024
They don’t have a regular posting schedule and whenever they do post, I rejoice in knowing they will continue to use that account
They recently published a music stems dropbox that continues the stems for all the songs within the game, including the menu and erect songs

In addition, although this is probably nothing, PhantomArcade published an Instagram story with new artwork of Darnell in it
This has led some users to speculate that this post was made in regards to the small content update 0.7.0 
(I literally check their GitHub daily for the milestone to see how complete it is, right now it’s at 38% with 16 open cases)
I think it’s just Phantom publishing for fun as this has happened before in December 2024, and thankfully I’m not the only one who believes this

So what do you think, should the FNF_Developer account publish more tweets?
In my opinion, they should probably only tweet when they need, but then again, more updates, whether status or otherwise, are heavily needed,
especially since the team has not published any proper blog posts since 2024 (yeah, I’m gonna keep mentioning this ‘til the die I perish)

That wraps it up for today’s post, thanks for stopping by and reading it all the way
I love doing these daily updates, they keep me grounded and patiently waiting for FNF, and I will continue doing them unless I forget
Anyways, star this repo, and make sure to Stay Knightly, my friends. Gooooodbyeeee

P.S. I would like to address something: I'm not a kid, I'm an adult who recently joined the community and is love with FNF,
though I would see why some people would assume I'm a youngin' , but trust me, I'm not, but I am quite young for my age group to be honest
