Hey everyone, it’s me Mester again, back with another post
Today’s one is gonna be a bit more serious than all my other ones and not really related to FNF that much

I’ve been thinking a lot lately about my life and the decisions I’ve made, whether I’m doing the right
If you’re not already, Summer Break started for me 2 weeks ago and I’ve not done much during that time
Sure, I’ve played some FNF and made progress on the levels, but that was a plan I’ve had for weeks before I did it, a way to reward
Now, I’m not really sure what to do, I’ve got two months until I have to go back to college and focus my time and effort there

I’m not saying that I’m seeing my future as grim, it’s just, I don’t know, worrying that with all the time in the world, most of it is spent on the Internet
Sometimes I forget that the reason why Youtube videos don’t have that many views, despite the original Youtuber having so many subs, is because those people are spending their time offline
It’s the reason why I misjudge view counts, get angry at people for not being interested in specific types of content (even if the anger is reserved and not really shown)
Thankfully, I don’t think this now, that video quality is based on many views and subscribers a person has, but if you would have asked before, I would said “definitely”

Since the COVID pandemic, I’ve become a lot more reserved, but also I’ve been a lot more expecting of fans, popularity
From what the Internet makes out of it, becoming popular is not a hard decision to do, you just need to put the time and effort
I did just that, but I never got the rewards other people had, probably because I wasn’t trying hard enough
At the same time, I had pressure from my family and friends (the good kind, don’t worry) to perform and do my best

I’m not trying to put my manifesto out here or convincing you to share these posts with anyone else (that would be a step in the wrong direction for me)
What I’m trying to say is that I’ve always been a person wanting attention and never feeling like it was enough 
I am coping with it currently, have been for almost 2 years now, but that doesn’t change the fact that I want more people to notice me, my efforts
I’ve created so many social media accounts, some natural like Twitter but others like Pixilart too, where the only goal was to try to fein for attention
During those days, I thought only about quantity over quality, how some content farms today works (at least it didn’t get that bad)

I guess what I’ve trying to say, the world would be much better off without me, or my presence on the Internet
I’m sorry that it got to this point where I’m abusing Github just to put my own stupid opinions out there
But what else I am supposed to do, ok, I practically have zero friends and live in a dead-end space where basically nothing ever happens
The Internet is practically my only means of escape to give me pleasure over what’s been going on right now
There is a silver lining though, at least I enjoy what’s going on, but dang, I need to change my life for the better

I’m gonna leave y’all with this, why do we exist?
Do we all have a certain purpose in life? Or do we all end up being degen lunatics who think posting on the Internet to curb their impatience over a stinkin’ rhythm game is a good idea?
Maybe I’m ranting, but I don’t really care anymore, after all, this is the Internet, we can post what we want, regardless of whether it’s hopeful or otherwise…

Update: I was just sulking, lol, you know how being Emo is sometimes a phase. Don't worry about me that much, 'kay, I'll let the attention get to my head and who knows
what'll happen, oh god 😆 Anyways, forget this post ever existed and life your life the way you should, I'll try my best to do just that from now on
Stay knightly, my friends, see y'all laterrrr maybeee
