Welcome to the first post about Friday Night Funkin! 
Hope you brought some water with you, cause we’re starting off spicyyyy

Here’s the cinch: It’s been confirmed by PhantomArcade, during a Twitch stream, that Boyfriend and Pico have been in a relationship with each other
Personally, I find that really cool, adding some LGBQT+ representation within the game

This can be taken even further as Pico is likely to date both males and females. 
We’ve seen it happen with Darnell in a now-deleted comic panel created by PhantomArcade and it’s also bound to happen with Nene (eventually, shippers, be more patient)
Anyways, I think it’s wonderful that the developers have made this canon, we could use some more of that representation in the media today

Moving aside from that, there are quite a bit of stakes to consider if BF was once Pico’s lover.
For example, does he know about the school shooting and Cassandra? If so, how? Through rumor or through Pico himself? 
Honestly, I feel this could lead to some interesting weeks if you consider these plot-points, hint hint wink wink

But anyways, that’s it for this post, stay tuned for the next one
You don’t know when I’ll post it but neither do I, so at least we’re at a standstill there

I know I’m not your “traditional” coder, but I would love some feedback!

As my alter-ego YouTube persona would say to close things off: Stay Knightly, my friends, goooodbyeeee
