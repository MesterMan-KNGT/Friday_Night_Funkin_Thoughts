Hello, all you amazing people. It’s that time once again, time for posting to the repo! *insert stock sound effect yay*
No, but seriously though, these are by-far the best part of my day, sitting down and writing these
I might make a post soon about how I do them (it’s actually quite simple)

Alright, now down to the meat and potatoes of the content (you can imagine posts as a burger, sandwiched by the intro and outro if you like)
Today, we’re talking about just about one of my favorite characters of FNF ever, including the mods too
I’ll give you a hint: He lives inside a dang video game
Yeah, that’s right, we’re talking about Senpai (also I know all the characters technically are “in” a video game, but shush, we’re not talking technicalities here)

Senpai is the most pleasant opponents that I’ve had the courage to take on, with both Boyfriend and Pico being amazing protagonists
However, while he may be a cool enemy, not much is known about him, besides what PhantomArcade and the other Funkin’ team give out as lore
So this post captures my headcanon of Senpai from Friday Night Funkin’ and it goes something like this:

Senpai is a jerk. Nothing more needs to be said about that
I mean, he comes from a game called Hating Simulator, honestly, what more evidence do you need
He acts like a total douchebag, but one who looks like he has his sh*t together 
He also pretends he’s the center of attention, the main character if you will, and with all those girls he calls “Roses” around, I’m not all that surprised
Becoming an ego-centric person, as a side note, is not a hard thing to do, I mean, just look at Elon Musk for example (please don’t cancel me, that was a joke)
But anyways, Senpai treats some people who find him dashing with respect and those who don’t, 
he tries to convince to the point where those people find him annoying because of it
He also is completely oblivious of gender identities and will call someone the f-slur despite using pronouns (I’m taking from PhantomArcade’s lore a bit here)

His life is not all sunshine and rainbows, however
He knows that Spirit is trapped inside him and that one day, he could be released and his death is imminent
Senpai is not too worried about that, however, as he knows absolutely no one will make him that angry
Well, that is, until he meets Boyfriend, who just happened to find himself inside the game in Week 6 (because it’s his Girlfriend’s copy)
After two rap battles, one being insanely difficult, Spirit gets so mad that he escapes from Senpai and Senpai is now dead
He finds himself in the void soon after, questioning everything he’s done and what’s he become, and will remain trapped there lonely until someone else dies

So yeah, that’s my HeadCanon. I know it’s a lot and it’s not quite concise in some areas, but I’m still working on it
You know what they say, Imagination is the greatest part of the human brain, or something like that
Anyways, that’s gonna do from me, thanks for reading this post to the end, and I hope you have a wonderful day
Stay knightly, my friends, byeeee
